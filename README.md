### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I'm Ben. I've been in IT for 20 years. I was an IC in software engineering for nearly a decade, focusing on web development and web usability. I moved to the management track. I was a software engineering manager for many years. Now, I run an IT department of over 60 people. I'm getting back into software after a long hiatus.
